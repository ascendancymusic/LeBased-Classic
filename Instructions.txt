Welcome to Le Based!

Open 'LeBased', you can drag this to the desktop (you don't ever need to open any folders)


--Common--
-"F11" to enter/exit fullscreen. The fullscreen goes full to however large you have resized the application window: I recommend using
fullscreen on fully maximized window.
-"ESC" to exit in Main Menu, in other Menus, "ESC" brings you back.
-The Switch in top left in Main Menu changes the theme.



--Menus--
-In ToDo Menu you can, swipe, use left and right arrow keys, or use the buttons to navigate.
-ToDo Menu might lag depending on your internet speed when you open a date for a first time, this is because it fetches the weather.

-Planner Menu is fully draggable and zoomable on mousewheel, you'll figure it out. It starts out with the initial
"Top" box (which you can rename btw) being high up, just drag the screen...
-You add nodes/ideas/boxes by dragging the '+' icon and releasing. If you just press the icon the node will leave at its place.
-Press 'CTRL' while dragging a box to drag all of its sub boxes.

-Sleepar Menu is self explanatory.

-Stats Menu shows data from Sleepar Menu. You can delete the data with the garbage bin icon.

-About Menu is self explanatory.



Enjoy!!!
